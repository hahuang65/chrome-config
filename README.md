# Chrome / Chromium

My personal configuration for [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home)
Note that these are specifically configuration files for Linux-based installations that read the `chrome-flags.conf` and `chromium-flags.conf` files.
I will do my best to comment the configuration file. Feel free to crib/steal this for your own personal use.

## Usage

Run `./install.sh` to link the configuration files to the proper location
